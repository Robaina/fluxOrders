1. Layout is not optimal in cell phones. Changed it and display every container on top of each other if mobile.
2. I think the best way is to display the graph whole screen and add a menu or some buttons to show the form, the plot and about whole screen too. The screen is way too small to render everything together. A collapsible menu can contain all the buttons triggering the actions.

### Some notes about the visualization

1. General graph layout is not optimal, any way to improve it?
2. Current dagre option is to fit container. This is not optimal
3. Perhaps display reaction names in a list to select the reaction for which the subgraph is extracted. Show a bigger version of the subgraph and a smaller version of the global graph, just for reference.
4. Show some metrics of the selected node: number of children, number of parents, some measure of centrality or structural importance of the selected node.
5. Perhaps show only rxn names that are selected when hovering. Display reaction list is a good idea. Select reaction from reaction list.
6. Perhaps only show the big graph... the smaller graph does not work for reactions with large number of interactions. Show number of parent, children and perhaps once one clicks there a window appears with the pie plots of the subsystems. Also, reaction names can appear on hovering. I have to solve first the issue of overlapping with existing labels...

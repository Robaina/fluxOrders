This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the results of the publication: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/731356v1" target="_blank">Flux-based hierarchical organization of _Escherichia coli_'s metabolic network</a>.

A Jupyter notebook with the followed workflow and all required python modules are located in the subdirectory: Robaina_Nikoloski_2019 of this repository.

Additionally, an interactive directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicting the flux-ordered pairs of _E. coli_'s central carbon metabolism can be found in the HTML "fluxOrderDAG.html" (Tested on desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge).

Finally, the publication, an online version of the Jupyter notebook and the interactive DAG can be accessed from https://robaina.github.io/fluxOrders (file "index.html").

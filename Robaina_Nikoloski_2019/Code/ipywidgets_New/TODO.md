# Things to do:
1. Would be cool to store the images in a directory, such as ipywidgets_static_images, and upload them from there dynamically. This way the notebook occupies far less memory.
2. Perhaps instantiate the JavaScript functions only once per notebook. This many there no conflicts with already declared variables.
